# Regression Analysis for Water Temperature Data

The goal of this analysis is to fill in data gaps where temperature data are missing or the time series is incomplete in order to make the dataset more useful for SR JPE modeling. Temperature is an important covariate in understanding juvenile production though the completeness of these data vary by location.

Currently this analysis relies on a regression model and is performed for the Feather River and Yuba River. The resulting dataset with predicted values is saved and integrated in the development of a water temperature dataset.

## Data used to build models: Butte Creek

Butte Creek is used to build the regression models because the time series is complete and the data are high quality.

  * Date range covered in the Butte Creek temperature data is 1999 - 2024
  
## Overall approach for water temperature regression:

1. Prepare datasets for regression analysis (dataset with no missing data is used to train the model and dataset with missing data are predicted using the model)

2. Fit and evaluate linear regression models for mean, min, and max temperatures 

3. Make predictions for missing data using the fitted models

4. Combine predictions with actual measurements

5. Visualize the predicted and actual temperature over time to asses model performance trends
