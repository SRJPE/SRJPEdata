\description{
Environmental gage data for each tributary in the SR JPE.
Data includes flow and temperature measurements from gages located on tributaries and the Sacramento River mainstem.
Data were compiled from CDEC, USGS, and USFWS sources and are summarized by week and statistic type.
Interpolation was performed to fill in data gaps where temperature data were missing or the time series was incomplete.
For the Feather River and Yuba River, temperature values were interpolated using regression models based on nearby gages and historical data, allowing for consistent estimation across incomplete records.
The temporal coverage of flow data ranges from 1930 to 2025, and temperature data ranges from 1994 to 2025.
