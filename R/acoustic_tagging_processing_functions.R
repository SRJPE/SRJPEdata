#' @param detections A dataframe containing detections information.

#' @details This function replaces receiver locations in the detections dataframe with aggregated locations for the Feather River region according to the specified replacement dictionary. It aggregates receiver locations into one and calculates the mean River Kilometer (RKM), Latitude, Longitude, and Region for each aggregated location. The function also updates the receiver metadata accordingly.
