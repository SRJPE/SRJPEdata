### Overview

The spring run juvenile production estimate (SR JPE) contains a suite of submodels that rely on different datasets. This document is currently focused on Chinook monitoring data that will be used to fit the stock recruit model and within season models. The within season model relies on juvenile data and the stock recruit relies on both juvenile and adult datasets.  

Additional sections will be added to highlight survival, genetics, and covariate data. 

# Modeling Data Selection

Gathering and identifying spring run Chinook monitoring data to use in the spring run juvenile production estimate (SR JPE) was an iterative, multistep process. 

Filtering applied to juvenile RST data - necessary for both within season and stock recruit model data. 

1) We acquired, processed and described monitoring that we presented in workshops to define a ruleset for evaluating years to exclude based on missing data ([see years to include vignette for an in depth overview of this process](https://srjpe.github.io/SRJPEdata/articles/years_to_include_analysis.html)). This filtered juvenile dataset is used for both the within season and stock recruit models. 

Additional filters required for the stock recruit: 

2) We selected data where there was both adult and juvenile data. 
3) We selected a single adult dataset to use for each year and stream. 


The diagram below visualizes this process and shows the total number of datasets we retained along the way.

*Distinct annual datasets are identified by looking at distinct year, stream, and monitoring types*

## Monitoring Data Overview

Extensive spring run Chinook monitoring is conducted throughout the Central Valley. Monitoring programs have been collecting data since the 1990s and monitoring has increased through time to expand monitoring types and data collection coverage across the seven tributaries and mainstem Sacramento River (identified as the geographic scope for the SR JPE).

The plot below shows all monitoring coverage of rotary screw trap, adult upstream passage, adult holding, adult redd, and adult carcass survey data.

*Plot does not include Sacramento River mainstem monitoring. This data may also be utilized in the SR JPE but will not be included in the stock recruit models. For some monitoring types data is collected annually or monthly communicated through gaps in the colored lines.*

## Excluding Incomplete Years 

Although the SR JPE aims to utilize all available data, there are some years where data is sparse and is excluded from analysis. This decision process is documented in the [Years to Include Analysis](https://srjpe.github.io/SRJPEdata/articles/years_to_include_analysis.html).

**Juvenile datasets filtered to exclude incomplete years.**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Set your custom colors
included_color <- "#9A8822"
excluded_color <- "gray"

# Load and join exclusion data
rst_years_to_exclude <- SRJPEdata::years_to_exclude_rst_data |>  
  mutate(exclude = TRUE)

rst_plot_data_with_exclusion <- rst_plot_data |> 
  left_join(rst_years_to_exclude |> 
              select(stream, site, year = run_year, exclude))  |> 
  mutate(exclude = ifelse(is.na(exclude), FALSE, exclude)) |>
  distinct(stream, year, exclude)

# Plot with gray for excluded and green for included
rst_years_plot <- ggplot(rst_plot_data_with_exclusion, aes(x = year, y = stream)) +
  
  # Gray squares for excluded years
  geom_point(
    data = rst_plot_data_with_exclusion |> filter(exclude),
    aes(x = year, y = stream),
    shape = 15, color = excluded_color, size = 6
  ) +
  
  # Green squares for included years
  geom_point(
    data = rst_plot_data_with_exclusion |> filter(!exclude),
    aes(x = year, y = stream),
    shape = 15, color = included_color, size = 6
  ) +
  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Juvenile RST Monitoring Years by Stream",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  ) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(unique(rst_plot_data$stream))) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Arial"),
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0)
  )

rst_years_plot
```

*Gray boxes indicate that monitoring occurred but data is not being utilized. Data may be excluded because the data was considered incomplete for a given monitoring type and year.*

**Adult dataset filtered to exclude incomplete years**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load exclusion data for adults
adult_years_to_exclude <- SRJPEdata::years_to_exclude_adult |>  
  mutate(exclude = TRUE) |> 
  rename(sampling_type = data_type)

# Apply to each adult dataset
adult_carcass_plot_data_excluded <- adult_carcass_plot_data |>  
  left_join(adult_years_to_exclude)

    shape = 15, color = excluded_color, size = 6
  ) +
  
  # Green squares for included adult years
  geom_point(

  )

```
*Gray boxes indicate that monitoring occurred but data is not being utilized. Data may be excluded because the data was considered incomplete for a given monitoring type and year.*

## Summary Table of Years to Use for Within Season

The summary table below describes which years remain after filtering out incomplete juvenile data. This table accounts for years excluded based on data quality and completeness considerations.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

rst_years_to_exclude <- SRJPEdata::years_to_exclude_rst_data |> 
  mutate(exclude = TRUE)

rst_plot_data_with_exclusion <- rst_plot_data |> 
  left_join(rst_years_to_exclude |> 
              select(stream, site, year = run_year, exclude))  |> 
  filter(is.na(exclude))

# Function to turn a vector of years into range strings
collapse_years_to_ranges <- function(years) {
  years <- sort(unique(years))
  ranges <- list()
  start <- years[1]
  end <- years[1]
  
  for (i in 2:length(years)) {
    if (years[i] == end + 1) {
      end <- years[i]
    } else {
      ranges <- append(ranges, list(c(start, end)))
      start <- years[i]
      end <- years[i]
    }
  }
  ranges <- append(ranges, list(c(start, end)))  # Append the final range
  
  # Convert each range to string
  range_strings <- sapply(ranges, function(r) {
    if (r[1] == r[2]) {
      as.character(r[1])
    } else {
      paste(r[1], r[2], sep = " - ")
    }
  })
  
  paste(range_strings, collapse = ", ")
}

# Apply the function in your summary
test <- rst_plot_data_with_exclusion |> 
  group_by(Stream = stream) |> 
  summarise(
    `Years to Include in Model` = collapse_years_to_ranges(year),
    `Total Number of Years` = n_distinct(year),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

knitr::kable(test)

test_for_sum <- test |> rename(num_years = `Total Number of Years`)
```

This table shows us that there are a total of `r sum(test_for_sum$num_years)` stream years to use for developing the SR JPE stock recruit model. 

### Filtering data to years that contain both juvinile and adult monitoring

After excluding incomplete years, the stock recruit data requires additional filtering. 
In order to utilize data for the stock recruit models, we need both juvenile data inputs (RST data) and adult data inputs (adults) for each year. The plot below shows the time windows where there is overlapping juvenile and adult monitoring on each tributary. While this limits the amount of data, it still provides a few large windows for most monitoring programs.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# TODO add a label with the number of years excluded
# TODO review with erin because looks like a lot of Feather River years are removed.
rst_years_to_exclude <- SRJPEdata::years_to_exclude_rst_data |> 
  mutate(exclude = TRUE)

adult_years_to_exclude <- SRJPEdata::years_to_exclude_adult |> 
  mutate(exclude = TRUE) |> 
  rename(sampling_type = data_type)

rst_plot_data <- rst_plot_data |>

*Gray boxes indicate that monitoring occurred but data is not being utilized for the stock recruit. Data may be excluded because there is not adult and juvenile annual overlap or because the data was considered incomplete for a given monitoring type and year.* 

## Summary Table of Years to Use for Stock Recruit

The summary table below describes which years have overlapping RST and adult data. This table accounts for years excluded based on data quality and completeness considerations.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

This table shows us that there are a total of `r sum(years_for_jpe$"Total Number of Years")` stream years to use for developing the SR JPE stock recruit model. 

## Selecting Adult Data Type to Use

There are 35 stream year combinations where there are multiple adult data types to pick from. These occur for: "butte creek", "battle creek", "clear creek", and "feather river."

The process of determining the appropriate adult data to use in stock recruit modeling for the SR JPE is currently ongoing. This information will be updated as the Modeling Team evaluates the tradeoffs associated with various data types in more detail.

We used the following logic to select data to use in these cases:

-   if `stream = "butte creek"` we used carcass estimate data (carcass estimate methods include mark recapture)
-   if `stream = "battle creek"` we used...TODO
-   if `stream = "clear creek"` we used...TODO
-   if `stream = "feather river"` we used...TODO

```{r, echo = FALSE}

*... with `r nrow(multiple_adult_data_options) - 10` more rows*

## Proposed Data to Use in SR JPE
